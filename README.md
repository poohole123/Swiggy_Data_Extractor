Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script (Script.py). Run the script using Python, providing the restaurant ID as a command-line argument. For example:

python Script.py <restaurant_id>
Replace `restaurant_id` with the ID of the restaurant whose menu data you want to extract.
The script will fetch the menu data, extract relevant details, and save them to a CSV file in the same directory.

#Functionality

The script interacts with the Swiggy API to fetch menu data for a specified restaurant ID. It then extracts relevant details such as dish names, prices, descriptions, and categories. Finally, it saves the extracted data to a CSV file in a structured format.

#Setup Steps

There are no additional setup steps required. Ensure you have Python installed and the required packages installed using `pip`.

#Troubleshooting: If you encounter any errors or issues while running the script, double-check the restaurant ID, ensure you have an active internet connection, and verify that you've installed the required libraries correctly.
